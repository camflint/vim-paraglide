* jumps to the beginnng or end of the paragraph
* works with motions (operator-pending mode) and visual mode


## Default mappings

|------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| `<down>`   | Start of next paragraph                         |
| `<up>`     | Start of previous paragraph                     |
| `g-<down>` | Start or end of next paragraph                  |

| `}`        | End (last non-blank line) of next paragraph     |

## Customization

To set up a custom mapping, add the following to your .vimrc:

```vim
" Use 'gj' and 'gk' to navigate up and down paragraph markers.
noremap <silent> gj <Plug>ParaglideDownAny
