## Motivation

The standard `}` and `{` paragraph motions jump to the blank lines before and after a paragraph, respectively, rather than to the start and end of the paragraph. If you want to change this behavior, you have to edit the somewhat-arcane _nroff_ macros of the`'paragraphs'` options.

The standard paragraph motions also don't work very well with blocks, such as when you want to select a vertical column in a markdown table. vim-paraglide provides flexible mappings for most use cases around paragraph navigation.


## Features

### Jump to edges

![Demo: jumping to all edges](media/demo1.gif)

Default keybinding: `<down>`/`<up>`.

### Jump to only top or bottom edges

![Demo: jumping to only top or bottom edges](media/demo2.gif)

Default keybindings:

+ `<s-down>`/`<s-up>` for top edges
+ `}`/`{` for bottom edges (similar to default paragraph motions)

Tip: hold down `shift` and use the arrow keys to move across paragraphs quickly, if you're just navigating through the file.

### Block, or column-aware jumps

![Demo: block, or column-aware jumps](media/demo3.gif)

Default keybinding: `g<down>`/`g<up>`.

This works by ignoring characters to the left of the cursor column when searching for a paragraph break.

| `g<up>`                 | Block-wise jump to previous edge    |


### Custom mappings

To set up a custom mapping, add the following to your .vimrc:

```vim
" Use 'gj' and 'gk' to navigate paragraphs instead of the arrow keys.
noremap <silent> gj <Plug>ParaglideDownAny
noremap <silent> gk <Plug>ParaglideUpAny
```

To see the full list of available keys, do:

```vim
:map <Plug>Paraglide <ENTER>
```
